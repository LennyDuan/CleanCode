//Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an accountList unless itâ€™s actually a List. The word list means something specific to programmers. 

//A truly awful example of disinformative names would be the use of lower-case L or uppercase O as variable names, especially in combination. 

// Bad Code
int a = l;
if ( O == l )
    a= O1;
else
    l = 01;
